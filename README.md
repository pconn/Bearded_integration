# Bearded_integration

This repository includes code to compile data and ultimately run an integrated model
for bearded seal "at sea" densities.  This idea is to combine information from aerial surveys,
close-kin mark-recapture abundance estimates, utilization distributions estimated from 
animals with satellite tags, and passive accoustic monitoring made at fixed moorings throughout the
Bering, Chukchi, and and Beaufort (BCB) Seas.
